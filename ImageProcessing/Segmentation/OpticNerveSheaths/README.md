Development of a Deep Learning-based system for Optic Nerve characterization in Transorbital Ultrasound Images on a multicenter dataset  

Official repository for the reproduction of the results presented in the article (doi doi doi doi doi). A smaller version of this work was presented at IUS 2021 (doi doi doi). Data, checkpoints of the trained models, and results have been shared using Zenodo platform and are available at (doi doi doi).

Development and training of the DL model has been coded using the awsome segmentation_models_pytorch library.
